# 🏊 EXPLAINING THE POOL

The 1337 Pool spans one month and is divided into four weeks. During this time, you'll work on various projects designed to enhance your coding skills and understanding of concepts such as loops, pointers, information handling, and basic memory management. Expect weekly tests—four in total. Ensure you solve at least two exercises for each test.

## 💡 MY EXPERIENCE

This experience has significantly enhanced my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. The 1337 Pool has been an incredible journey of growth and mastery, pushing me to refine my craft and achieve excellence in software development.
